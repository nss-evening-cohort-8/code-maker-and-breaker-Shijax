## Scope of Project

<p> Pop Quiz to find out where we as students stand in the progress of this course after Milestone One. </p>
<p> Concept is to create an HTML page with two unique forms capable of taking text input and printing said input to the DOM in a browser. One form should take an alphabetic word and convert this word to UTF-16. The form should have a clickable button that enacts a function based on an event listener in the javascript.  The value of the UTF-16 should be printed to the DOM below the form.  Tjs second form should function the same except the function should convert the UTF-16 entered into an alphabetic word and print the word to the DOM below the form.</P>
